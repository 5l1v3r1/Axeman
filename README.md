## What?
Axeman is a utility for downloading, parsing, and storing <a href="">Certificate Transparency Lists</a> using python3's concurrency and multi-processing. Its aim is to download and parse certificates relatively quickly and efficiently, storing them in CSVs on the local filesystem. 

## Installing it
Installation should be super straight forward, but you need a newer version of python (3.5+) to run it.

```
pip3 install axeman
```
